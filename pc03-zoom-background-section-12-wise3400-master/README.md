<br>
Download these files in order to get a fast start to your Programming Challenge. In this folder you'll find:
<br><b>     1. PC03 start code</b>- Imports turtle and math, creates a window for you!
<br><b>     2. Spirograph snippet</b>- Contains a bit of code that draws a square and circle spirograph. <b>READ THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE FILE BEFORE USING.</b>
<br><b>     3. In-class Example code</b>- Contains the wave example built in class with detailed comments, for review/help.

For this assignment, you will have to turn in: (1) Your code (.py file), (2) your pseudocode (.docx, .rtf, .txt), (3) a screenshot of your final piece!
<br>
Note: You do NOT have to use parametric equations or spirographs in this assignment...I just think they're fun.
