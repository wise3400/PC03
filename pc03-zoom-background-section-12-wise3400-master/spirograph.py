How to borrow code

    1. You MUST create a comment that says what the code you're borrowing does
    and where you got it from (ATLS1300 example code). 
    2. You MAY NOT copy this code or use this code as start code. 
    Only take what you need.
    3. Copy the sections between the ======= lines (lines 32-45, and/or, 
                                                    lines 51-70)
    And paste it in your code! 
    
    Do not take what you do not understand!
